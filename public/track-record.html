      <h2 class="center black-text">A PROVEN HISTORY OF EXCELLENCE</h2>
      <h5 class="center">Determining the metrics that define your executive recruiting firm is paramount to guiding the 
        future success of your consultants, and ultimately the firm as a whole. Our search consultants have spent entire 
        careers validating our insights regarding placement rate, days to placement, stick rate, and many more relevant 
        metrics in the field of executive search.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="center">
          Our firm is made up of consultants who, together, have over 50 years of combined experience placing over 500 executives 
          within some of the most recognized brands in the world. Over these years spent rigorously redefining success, we have 
          curated a data set which we have utilized to cultivate our internal processes, as well as the metrics by which we are known. 
          However, more importantly, we have spent these 50 combined years impressing upon our clients that our services are not only 
          helpful in very time-sensitive areas, but also in long-term consultancy aspects as well. We have formed business 
          partnerships spanning decades with some of the most well-known firms in the world, such as KPMG. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="center">
          In working with us, KPMG was able to utilize our knack for finding nearly unidentifiable leadership traits within individuals 
          we interviewed for positions within the firm. During the tenure of our business partnership, we were able to make over 100 
          placements over a 10 year period, ultimately assisting them in growing their advisory business to becoming a leading entity 
          within the marketplace. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="center">
          This type of executive recruiting firm partnership enabled KPMG to take advantage of numerous benefits, including favorable pricing, 
          which dropped their average fee around 13%. As KPMG’s position as a key strategic client became more solidified, the best 
          talent the market could bear at the time was directed towards the firm. Each and every search performed was treated as if 
          it were our first, which allowed us to make upfront investments with line managers and create a custom search strategy each 
          time we initiated a new project. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="center">
          This type of consultative approach outlines a lasting relationship between two business entities, allowing each entity to 
          truly understand and propel the other forward. Ensuring that we represent each and every one of our clients accurately and 
          efficiently is incredibly important, and we believe KPMG is a shining example out of many different examples we’ve curated 
          over the years in executive search. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="center">
          If you are open-minded to discussing how this type of consultative relationship could benefit your firm, please don’t hesitate to contact us today.
